# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?

I was very proud of my work today. I found that I had some challenges when creating the functions and making sure that I was returning the correct value, as well as using the built in methods correctly. However, I managed to figure it out quickly without feeling like I got stuck on something. I stayed calm when my program didn't work the first time, and solved it using the skill i've built so far.

- In your own words, why are functions a powerful tool in our applications?

Functions allow you to create specific sections of code for specific tasks. Those functions can then be called numerous times throughout your program, without having to constantly write out the same section of code over and over again. It save alot of time and work, as well as make you code easier to read and understand.
